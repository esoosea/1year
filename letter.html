			Dear Tuzi
		</h1>
			
		<h2>
			Hello! This is my very bunny first time creating an interactive card experience.. on the interwebs!! I may have ripped 85-90% of all the code itself, but I still feel quite accomplished about being able to manipulate the css hehe
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Happy Valentines Day & Happy 1 year anniversary!! I am quite lucky to be able to call you mine. I know I still have a lot of growing to do, but I wanted to say thank you for all that you have done for me. From taking care of my when my kidneys were dying, to sending me flowers whilest we were apart, you have shown me in so many different ways that you care. I hope that in the future days to come, I can be there for you the same way that you have always been there for me. 
		</h3>
		<h4>
			Thank you, bunny for dealing with a little lump like me. I sorry for creating some frustrations in your life like when I tell you I'll wake up and then I don't, or when I scream at you to keep watching Attack on Titan hehe I hope I can be better with each day that comes by. Thank you bunny for always showing me that you care and for being someone that I know that I can always lean on (both physically and mentally heheheheh)
		</h4>
		<h5>
			I love you bunny bun! You're the best bunny bun. I promise I'll put in the effort to keep on learning so that we can grow upwards together! I love you!

			Happy 1 Year!
